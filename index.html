  <p> Welcome to the <b>VariAbility Lab</b> at <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b>. Our research mission is to create inclusive workplaces
  where all people can be successful, without discrimination, especially those with disabilities and the neurodivergent.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our current
  research projects focus on creating accommodative physical work environments, collaboration tools that facilitate communication between
  people with differing abilities, and educational programs that teach communication skills and improve social relationships between team
  members.
  </p>

  <p>
     We are recruiting students (PhD, Masters, and Undergraduates) for Spring 2023. If you are interested in working on any of our projects,
