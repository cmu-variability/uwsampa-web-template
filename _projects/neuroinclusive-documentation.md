subtitle: An accessible and inclusive platform for eliminating cognitive barriers in pedagogical material

description: |
   Current pedagogical materials don't play to the strengths of people with cognitive differences, such as ADHD, dyslexia, and autism, that impose barriers to learning. Our goal is to remove these barriers by creating a new learning platform that alters materials based on one's cognitive style.
