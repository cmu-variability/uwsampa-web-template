  abstract={COVID-19 accelerated the trend toward remote software development, increasing the need for tightly-coupled synchronous collaboration. Existing tools and practices impose high coordination overhead on blind or visually impaired (BVI) developers, impeding their abilities to collaborate effectively, compromising their agency, and limiting their contribution. To make remote collaboration more accessible, we created CodeWalk, a set of features added to Microsoft's Live Share VS Code extension, for synchronous code review and refactoring. We chose design criteria to ease the coordination burden felt by BVI developers by conveying sighted colleagues' navigation and edit actions via sound effects and speech. We evaluated our design in a within-subjects experiment with 10 BVI developers. Our results show that CodeWalk streamlines the dialogue required to refer to shared workspace locations, enabling participants to spend more time contributing to coding tasks. This design offers a path towards enabling BVI and sighted developers to collaborate on more equal terms.},

  abstract={Although the number of blind or low vision (BLV) software developers is the largest minority population of developers with physical disabilities, they are often marginalized in mainstream online programming communities. We studied how BLV developers engage with a BLV-specific programming community called Program-L, by exploring the help-seeking behaviors of novices. We analyzed 173 messages written by 20 novices over a 4-year period and identified the kinds of help they asked for and their justifications for requesting that help. We learned that self disclosure, practical assistance, and community dynamics were all critical activities to support four types of novices: community, domain, programming, and accessibility. The findings of our work give insight into what support can look like for online communities for marginalized software developers.},

However, autistic students do not get to practice teamwork since much of their education is focused on learning social skills. The hybrid mode of education comes with challenges, including communication and collaboration issues and teaming difficulties, however, this method of teaching and learning can be difficult for students with autism.  In this experience report paper, we discuss our experience planning and running a hybrid camp to teach teamwork and programming to 14 autistic high school students.  Overall, our camp was successful in teaching students software development skills with open source software, and, from our experience, we detail our lessons learned and provide recommendations for educators and researchers working with autistic students in a hybrid setting.},

 but also their research, their participation in extracurricular activities, and other aspects of student life. Further, 
 the process of obtaining access and accommodations should not add to the challenges that students with disabilities 
 ace on campus. Realizing these goals require addressing a wide range of problems and opportunities, as we outline in this 
 white paper. In this document, we discuss how the culture of computing as a discipline can and should change to better 
 realize the vision of full participation by students with disabilities, as well as to promote greater contributions 
 by computer scientists to the technology of accessibility. Our discussion is framed around this central idea of 
 developing accessibility as a cultural competency in computing, rather than smaller, individual efforts to tackle 
 inclusion within the discipline. We then frame these challenges and opportunities from the perspective of students and 
 faculty.},

from their home. In this new, virtual environment, accessibility barriers changed, in some respects for the better (e.g., more flexibility)
and in other aspects, for the worse (e.g., problems including American Sign Language interpreters over video calls). Microsoft Research
held its first cohort of all virtual interns in 2020. We the authors, full time and intern members and affiliates of the Ability Team, a
research team focused on accessibility, reflect on our virtual work experiences as a team consisting of members with a variety of
abilities, positions, and seniority during the summer intern season. Through our autoethnographic method, we provide a nuanced view
into the experiences of a mixed-ability, virtual team, and how the virtual setting affected the team’s accessibility. We then reflect on
these experiences, noting the successful strategies we used to promote access and the areas in which we could have further improved
access. Finally, we present guidelines for future virtual mixed-ability teams looking to improve access.}

  employees and their neurotypical coworkers face communication challenges due to pronounced differences in styles 
  and preferences. These difficulties lead to breakdowns in communication, collaboration, and coordination which can 
  leave autistic employees feeling isolated and stigmatized. To increase the knowledge and improve attitudes of 
  neurotypical employees about autism, we created and evaluated a training module for neurotypical employees about 
  effectively communicating with their autistic colleagues, thus flipping the traditional burden to adapt from 
  autistic workers to their non-autistic colleagues. Our formative results show that people who took the course 
  increased their knowledge about their own and the communication styles and preferences of autistic people. 
  They acquired skills on how to negotiate these style differences before engaging in conversations with their 
  colleagues.},

Eye trackers provide researchers with insights on software engineers’ cognitive processes, data that can augment those acquired through other means, such as on-line surveys and questionnaires. While there are many ways to take advantage of eye trackers, advancing their use requires defining standards for experimental design, execution, and reporting. We begin by presenting the foundations of eye tracking to provide context and perspective. Based on previous surveys of eye tracking for programming and software engineering tasks and our collective, extensive experience with eye trackers, we discuss when and why researchers should use eye trackers as well as how they should use them. We compile a list of typical use cases—real and anticipated—of eye trackers, as well as metrics, visualizations, and statistical analyses to analyze and report eye-tracking data. We also discuss the pragmatics of eye tracking studies. Finally, we offer lessons learned about using eye trackers to study software engineering tasks. This paper is intended to be a one-stop resource for researchers interested in designing, executing, and reporting eye tracking studies of software engineering tasks.},

us to reconsider how our design process led to a prototype that they did not find useful. We 
reflect on the design challenges around developing AI technology for an autistic user population, 
how Wizard of Oz prototypes can be overly optimistic in representing AI-driven prototypes, 
how autistic research participants can respond differently to user experience prototypes 
of varying fidelity, and how designing for people with diverse abilities needs to include 
that population in the development process.},

 However, these skills are often difficult to learn for
students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We designed, 
developed, and ran a 13-day, remote video game coding camp 
for incoming college first-year students with ASD. We 
developed instructional materials to teach computer programming, 
video game design, and communication and teaming skills. Students 
used the MakeCode Arcade development environment to build their 
games and Zoom to remotely collaborate with their teammates. In 
summative interviews, students reported improved programming skills, 
increased confidence in communication, and better experiences working 
with others. We also found that students valued the opportunity 
to practice teaming, such as being more vocal in expressing ideas 
to their peers and working out differences of opinion with their 
teammates. Two students reported the remote learning environment 
decreased their anxiety and stress, both are frequent challenges 
for autistic people. We plan to rerun the camp next year with 
materials that we have made available online.}

                  autistic adults about their perceptions of VC compared to other computer-mediated communications (CMC) and face-to-face
                  interactions. We developed a neurodiversity-sensitive model of CMC that describes how stressors such as sensory
                  sensitivities, cognitive load, and anxiety, contribute to their preferences for CMC channels. We learned that they apply
                  significant effort to construct coping strategies to support their sensory, cognitive, and social needs. These strategies
                  include moderating their sensory inputs, creating mental models of conversation partners, and attempting to mask their
                  autism by adopting neurotypical behaviors. Without effective strategies, interviewees experience more stress, have less
                  capacity to interpret verbal and non-verbal cues, and feel less empowered to participate. Our findings reveal critical
                  needs for autistic users. We suggest design opportunities to support their ability to comfortably use VC, and in doing so,
                  point the way towards making VC more comfortable for all.}

This impedes a pair's ability to efficiently communicate about on-screen locations and makes synchronous coordination difficult. We designed a novel gaze visualization for remote pair programmers which shows where in the code their partner is currently looking, and changes color when they are looking at the same thing. Our design is unobtrusive, and transparently depicts the imprecision inherent in eye tracking technology. We evaluated our design with an experiment in which pair programmers worked remotely on code refactoring tasks. Our results show that with the visualization, pairs spent a greater proportion of their time concurrently looking at the same code locations. Pairs communicated using a larger ratio of implicit to explicit references, and were faster and more successful at responding to those references.},

In this paper, we explore the hidden lives of neurodiverse technology workers, e.g., those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and/or other learning disabilities, such as dyslexia. We present findings from interviews with 10 neurodiverse technology workers, identifying the challenges that impede these employees from fully realizing their potential in the workplace. Based on the interview findings, we developed a survey that was taken by 846 engineers at a large software company. In this paper, we reflect on the differences between the neurotypical (N = 781) and neurodiverse (N = 59) respondents. Technology companies struggle to attract, develop, and retain talented software developers; our findings offer insight into how employers can better support the needs of this important worker constituency.}
